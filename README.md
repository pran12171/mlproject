# Air Pollution Anomaly Detection Using DBSCAN and Isolation Forest

## Project Overview

This project detects unusual air pollution observations using unsupervised machine learning techniques.

The project uses two anomaly detection algorithms:

1. DBSCAN
2. Isolation Forest

The system works with air-quality and environmental parameters such as PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO2, SO2, O3, temperature, and humidity.
